# Plan
**Not ordert after when to be build!**
1. Make this a *package*
   - be able to import
   - be able to create a acount_system class instance
2. For each acount create a folder with the DBs and stuff
3. Make DBs store images
4. Create an acount_system class wich can be modified by users
   - I mean like if you want to create an acount system you can specify what it stores
     - How it shows that
5. Super user implamentaion
